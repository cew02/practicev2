# Practice v2
I have to start over in my learning, as the software I was using is out of my budget range and my free trial ended :p

## Explanation
Will include things like ```print("hello world")``` and ```#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello world!");
    return 0;
}```

## Summary
Anyway, this is my new practice repository. I am using this in order to enhance my knowledge in computer science and programming.
